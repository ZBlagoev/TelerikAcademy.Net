/*
Write a program that generates and prints all possible cards from a standard 
deck of 52 cards (without the jokers).

The cards should be printed using the classical notation (like 5 of spades, 
A of hearts, 9 of clubs; and K of diamonds).
The card faces should start from 2 to A.
Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.
Use 2 nested for-loops and a switch-case statement.
